### Creating an ORDERED list

7. If you can't get the table to display properly after a few hours,

`**Make it bold!**`  
`__Make it bold!__`

**Make it bold!**  
__Make it bold!__

`*Make it italicized*`
`_Make it italicized_`

\`departments\`

`departments` 



### Creating a *block* of code-like (courier) font

`



### Horizontal rules

### Inserting an image
 

To create a link to an image (especially useful for embedding screenshots into your README files), you first enclose the TEXT that is the ALT (description) of the image inside of SQUARE brackets:

`[image of a foo]`

Then you put the actual path inside of parenthesis directly following the text:

`(https://foo.com/foo.png)`

This is what it looks like in practice:

`[image of a foo](https://foo.com/foo.png)`

(When an image is provided, it will show up here.)





### Hyperlink


To create a hyperlink, you first enclose the TEXT that represents the link inside of SQUARE brackets:

`[click here for a rundown]`

Then you put the actual link inside of parenthesis directly following the text:

`(https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)`

This is what it looks like in practice:

`[click here for a rundown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)`

[click here for a rundown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
