## Overview

Well, this was a confusing assignment. It was hard to determine whether we were supposed to re-create what the instructor and TAs had given us as an example or if we were supposed to use it as a basis for our own creation. Since it was so unclear to me at the time, I simply made a pixel-perfect clone of the example - colors, layout, and all. This was my third (and final) attempt from way back in 2017, however, I've recently been inspired to get in and fix it up properly.

### Just 'th facts...

As this assignment was early in our six-month course, at the point we were asked to complete this exercise, we had only just been introduced to html, css, and Bootstrap 3. Although I could make quick work of the markup and free-form CSS, with course content coming at us like water from a fire hose, I hadn't yet build up a reasonable level of confidence using the Bootstrap grid system yet.

#### What the portfolio hopes to showcase

I've been a front-end designer for a *long* time. I've also been a sys admin for IIS servers at various times throughout the years. The coding bootcamp course I completed was a welcomed bridge between those experiences. So, although I've got plenty of examples out there of front-end design work that I've done, the intent here is to bring focus to interactive programming projects that I am capable of (and those that I am most proud of!).
