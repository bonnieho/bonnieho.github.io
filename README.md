## Overview

Well, this was a confusing assignment. It was hard to determine whether we were supposed to re-create what the instructor and TAs had given us as an example or if we were supposed to use it as a basis for our own creation. Since it was so unclear to me at the time, I simply made a pixel-perfect clone of the example - colors, layout, and all. This was my third (and final) attempt from way back in 2017, however, I've recently been inspired to get in and fix it up properly.

### Just 'th facts...

As this assignment was early in our six-month course, at the point we were asked to complete this exercise, we had only just been introduced to html, css, and Bootstrap 3.
